# RSA-Encryption-Project

This project was a project I did with my friend for our Java class. It uses the same math and concepts as RSA encryption to encrypt strings.
We used the BigInteger libaray to get it as close as we can to real RSA encryption. We also built a random prime number generator for
the generation of keys, however it is somewhat slow and not optimized. I learned a lot from this project as it taught me how to collaborate
with others, and how to build a program which is object oriented.
